<h1>Assignment 1 Scenario</h1>
<p>As a regional manager for a chain of car dealerships you need to create some visualizations to allow you to understand your car sales and profits for each dealer.

  <h3>Guidelines for the Submission</h3>
Download the file CarSalesByModelStart.xlsx. Upload and open the file in Excel for the web.

<h3> Tasks to perform:</h3>
Create visualizations for the following captured KPI metrics:

<br>'Quantity Sold' by 'Dealer ID' - as a bar chart, sorted in either ascending or descending order of quantity sold, and change the chart title to "Quantity Sold by
Dealer ID" (Hint: Use the pivot table on Sheet1, and use 'Format' on the 'Chart' tab to change the chart title) </br>
<br>'Profit' by 'Date' and 'Model' - as a line chart, and give the chart a title of "Profit by Date and Model" (Hint: Use the pivot table on Sheet2, and use 'Chart
Title' on the 'Chart' tab to change the chart title)</br>
<br>'Profit' by 'Year' and 'Dealer ID' - as a column chart, titled "Profit by Year and Dealer ID" with the data columns in red (Hint: Use the pivot table on Sheet3, and
use 'Format' on the 'Chart' tab to change the chart title and to format the 'series' fill color in red)</br>
<br>'Sum of Profits' for 'Hudson model cars' by 'Dealer ID' - as a line chart, titled "Profit of Hudson Models by Dealer ID". Also remove the horizontal gridlines from
the chart, put the legend on the right side of the chart, and color the series outline in green. (Hint: Use the pivot table on Sheet4, use 'Gridlines' in the 'Axes'
group on the 'Chart' tab to remove the gridlines, and use 'Format' on the 'Chart' tab to change the chart title, to move the legend, and to format the 'series' outline
color in green)</br>
<br>Save your workbook: Use 'Save As' to save your completed workbook as CarSalesByModelEnd.xlsx</br>
<h3>Grading Information</h3>
For your assignment to be graded in a subsequent step in the course, you will be required to upload the completed Excel for the web workbook that you saved in Task 5.

  <h3>The main grading criteria will be:</h3>

Have you used the correct visualizations?
Have you titled the charts correctly?
Have you formatted the chart elements as directed?
Have you saved the workbook for grading?

  <h1>Assignment 2 Scenario</h1>
<p>As a regional manager for a chain of car dealerships you need to build out a dashboard to allow you to understand your sales and service departments.
 <h3> Guidelines for the Submission</h3>
Use the course videos and hands-on lab from Module 2 Lesson 2 ‘Creating Dashboards Using IBM Cognos Analytics’ to help you complete the following tasks:

<h3> Tasks to perform:</h3>
Create two dashboards as follows:

One dashboard using the tabbed template that has 4 small rectangles at the top and a large rectangle below - rename this dashboard tab to Sales.

One dashboard using the 2 x 2 rectangle areas tabbed template - rename this dashboard tab to Service.

Capture the following KPI metrics as visualizations:

On the Sales dashboard, capture the following KPI metrics:

In the first small rectangle (Panel 1), capture Profit (formatted to 1 decimal place in millions of US dollars)
In the second small rectangle (Panel 2), capture Quantity sold
In the third small rectangle (Panel 3), capture Quantity sold by model (as a bar chart)
In the fourth small rectangle (Panel 4), capture Average quantity sold

On the Sales dashboard in the large rectangle (Panel 5), display 'Profit' by 'Dealer ID' as a column chart, sorted in ascending order.

On the Service dashboard, capture the following KPI metrics as visualizations:
In the top left area (Panel 1), capture the number of recalls per model of car (as a column chart)
In the top right area (Panel 2), capture the customer sentiment by comparing positive, neutral, and negative reviews (as a treemap)
In the bottom left area (Panel 3), capture the quantity of cars sold per month compared to the profit (as a line and column chart).
In the bottom right area (Panel 4), capture the number of recalls by model and affected system (as a heat map). This will help us understand if there are any outliers for a given model or a specific system.

To export your dashboard as a PDF, follow instructions below:
On the application toolbar of your dashboard page, click Share icon.

On the Export tab, check Include filters and click Export.

On the Print pop-up page, in the Destination drop-down list, select Save as PDF.

Save the PDF file on your local machine to any location you like (preferably your Downloads folder) for later upload and submission to the coursera platform.

<h3>Grading Information</h3>
For your assignment to be graded in a subsequent step in the course, you will be required to upload the PDFs of your Cognos Analytics dashboards that you exported to your Downloads folder in Task 4. You will upload these exported PDFs to the Coursera platform as part of your submission. (Important: If you cannnot export your dashboards as PDFs for any reason, then you must take screenshots of your two dashboards, and submit these for grading instead).

<h3>The main grading criteria will be:</h3>

Have the correct tabs been created?
Have you captured the correct metrics?
Are the results correct?
Have you used the appropriate visualizations on the dashboard?
